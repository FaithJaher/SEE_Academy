# Fun Calculator 🎉

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator** — your friendly Python program to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers with style! 😎✨

## Features

- Accepts two numbers (including decimals) from the user.
- Performs four basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition ➕
  - Subtraction ➖
  - Multiplication ✖️
  - Division ➗
- Displays results in a clear and fun way.

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script.
2. When prompted, enter the first number (decimals allowed).
3. Enter the second number.
4. The program calculates and prints:
   - Sum
   - Difference
   - Product
   - Quotient

## Important Notes

- The program uses `float()` to accept decimal numbers.
- Please **do not enter zero as the second number**, or the program will raise a division-by-zero error.
- This is a simple demo, so no error handling is included yet.

## Example

```
Enter the first number: 10.5
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.5
Difference: 8.5
Product: 21.0
Quotient: 5.25
```
